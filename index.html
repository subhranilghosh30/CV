    <p>I am Subhranil Ghosh, a <strong>full stack web developer</strong> currently pursuing BTech degree in Computer Science and Engineering (6th Semester) at GIMT- Guwahati, Assam.
      I am an innovative thinker who loves to give shapes to intersting ideas and apply them into the real world. I try to solve issues as far as I can
      of both personal as well as proffesional and academic. In leisure times, I love to write poems and prefer to read novels and stories. My current reading is
     <em>Lands of Lost Border</em> by <em>Kate Harris</em>. Also, I love to play football and watch matches and try to interpret and learn important
     tactics out of it. A music and Indian Tea lover, who tries to remain calm in difficult situations and tries to maturely handle adverse situations.
